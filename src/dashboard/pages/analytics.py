        - Configure swap space appropriately for system stability

        **Network Optimization:**
        - Monitor market data feed latency and optimize connections
        - Implement connection pooling for API calls to reduce overhead
        - Use compression for large data transfers when appropriate
        - Configure quality-of-service (QoS) for critical trading traffic

        **Trading Performance:**
        - Optimize order execution algorithms for better fill rates
        - Monitor slippage and implement smart order routing
        - Use historical analysis to optimize position sizing
        - Implement risk controls to prevent excessive exposure

        ### Best Practices

        1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check metrics dashboard daily
        2. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust alert thresholds based on usage patterns
        3. **Capacity Planning**: Plan for growth and peak usage scenarios
        4. **Performance Baselines**: Establish normal operating ranges
        5. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular system optimization and updates
