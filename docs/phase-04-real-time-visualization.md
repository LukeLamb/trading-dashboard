## Debugging Notes

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Chart Performance:**
  - Limit data points for real-time charts (1000-2000 max)
  - Use data decimation for historical views
  - Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
  - Optimize Plotly configuration for performance

- **Real-time Updates:**
  - Test with mock data streams first
  - Handle connection losses gracefully
  - Implement exponential backoff for reconnections
  - Add circuit breakers for failed updates

- **Data Quality Issues:**
  - Validate all incoming data before charting
  - Handle missing or null data points
  - Implement data interpolation for gaps
  - Add data validation indicators

- **Browser Compatibility:**
  - Test on multiple browsers and versions
  - Handle WebSocket fallbacks properly
  - Optimize for mobile/tablet viewing
  - Test with different screen resolutions

## Implementation Notes

- Start with basic candlestick charts before adding complex indicators
- Test real-time updates with simulated data first
- Focus on Market Data integration before other agents
- Prioritize performance over advanced features
- Document all chart configuration options
