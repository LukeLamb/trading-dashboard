## üìã **What We're Doing**

Transforming the Trading Dashboard to match the LocalAI Finance website with:
- **Dark futuristic theme** (Indigo/Purple/Cyan colors)
- **Glass morphism design** (like the website)
- **Professional polish** for demo videos
- **Demo mode** for easy recording

---

## ‚ö° **Implementation Order**

### **Phase 1: Theme Foundation** (2-3 hours)
1. Create `.streamlit/config.toml` with website colors
2. Build `src/dashboard/assets/custom.css` with glass morphism
3. Load fonts (Orbitron, Inter, JetBrains Mono)
4. Test theme loads correctly

**Deliverable:** Dashboard has website's dark theme

---

### **Phase 2: Page Redesign** (3-4 hours)
Redesign pages in order of importance:
1. **Overview** - Hero section, agent status cards
2. **Charts** - Dark Plotly theme, gradient accents
3. **Analytics** - System metrics, glass cards
4. **Alerts** - Glow effects by severity
5. **Agents** - Control interface
6. **Error Handling** - Diagnostic panels

**Deliverable:** All pages match website aesthetic

---

### **Phase 3: Demo Mode** (2-3 hours)
1. Create demo mode toggle
2. Add 5 pre-configured scenarios
3. Optimize for smooth recording
4. Test all scenarios

**Deliverable:** Demo-ready dashboard

---

### **Phase 4: Polish** (2-3 hours)
1. Test responsiveness (1920x1080 for recording)
2. Fix performance issues
3. Add smooth animations
4. Final QA pass

**Deliverable:** Production-ready for recording

## üí° **Tips**

1. **Start small:** Get the theme working first before redesigning components
2. **Test often:** Run `streamlit run src/dashboard/main.py` after each change
3. **Match exactly:** Use website color codes exactly (no "close enough")
4. **Mobile-first:** Even though recording at 1920x1080, keep responsive
5. **Performance matters:** Dashboard must be smooth for good recordings
