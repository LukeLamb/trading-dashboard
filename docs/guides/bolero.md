# Bolero Account Setup Guide

To sign up for Bolero, you need a Belgian phone number and will use a tool like
itsme for identification and signing your contract, unless you're a KBC customer, who can use the KBC Mobile app. You must be an adult and a Belgian resident, and will need to provide information for a Belgian current account to link for transactions. You can create an individual or joint account online via a computer, but joint accounts cannot be made on the app, according to Curvo.

## Requirements for Individual Accounts

    Belgian residency and phone number: You must be an adult resident in Belgium and have a Belgian phone number. 

itsme: You will need to use this Belgian digital identity platform to identify yourself and sign your contract. 
Belgian current account: You must have a Belgian current account that you will link to your Bolero account for transactions. 

How to Sign Up (Individual Account)

    Use the website or app: Go to the Bolero website or download the Bolero mobile app on your smartphone.
    Start the application: Select the option to open a free account.
    Identify with itsme: Choose the option to sign up with itsme, which uses your Belgian phone number and unique itsme code.
    Follow the on-screen steps: Complete the necessary information to fill out your account application, and sign your contract electronically using itsme.
    Link your Belgian current account: Provide the details for your Belgian current account to facilitate money transfers to and from your Bolero account. 

For KBC Customers

    If you are a KBC customer, you can also open your Bolero account directly within the KBC Mobile or KBC Touch apps by choosing the option to open a Bolero account. 

For Joint Accounts

    You can only create a joint account using a computer, not on the Bolero mobile app. You will need to indicate that you want to open a joint account during the online registration process. 

    Bolero is KBC Bank NV’s online investment platform, limited to receiving and executing orders or transmitting orders in accordance with its order execution policy. Bolero doesn’t give investment advice.

    If you want to buy complex financial products using Bolero, it will ask you some questions to test your knowledge and experience of these types of products to assess whether they’re appropriate for you. You must have the required knowledge to place orders for complex products (including options, warrants and structured products).
    In the case of non-complex products like shares and ordinary bonds, it’s up to you to assess whether they’re appropriate for you and you don’t need to take a test. Bolero doesn’t assess how appropriate these products are for you, so the protection rules don’t apply. You should also remember that some products have potentially limited liquidity, entailing additional risks and possibly limiting negotiability.

As Bolero only lets you buy products on your own initiative, it cannot fully check whether you belong to a product’s target market.

Start your investment knowledge and experience test below. It’s divided by complex product, so you can choose the complex products you’re tested on, depending on the ones in which you’re considering investing. Remember that you must successfully complete the test before you can place an order for a complex product. Check out our Bolero Academy to learn more about available products. If you only invest in non-complex products (like shares), you have to assess whether they’re suitable for you and you don’t need to take a test.
