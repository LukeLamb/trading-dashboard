  - [ ] Create `src/orchestrator/health_monitor.py`
  - [ ] Implement HealthMonitor class
  - [ ] Add multi-agent health checking
- [ ] Create status aggregation and reporting
  - [ ] Implement system-wide health status aggregation
  - [ ] Add health metrics collection

  - [ ] Add health check performance monitoring

## Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests

- [ ] BaseClient methods work correctly
- [ ] MarketDataClient connects to test endpoints
- [ ] Pydantic models validate data correctly
- [ ] Health monitoring functions properly
- [ ] Retry logic handles failures appropriately

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Successfully connect to Market Data Agent (if available)
- [ ] Health checks return proper status
- [ ] API communication handles network issues
- [ ] Data models parse real API responses
- [ ] Scheduled health checks execute correctly

### Performance Tests

- [ ] API response times are acceptable (<500ms)
- [ ] Connection pooling improves performance
- [ ] Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during polling
- [ ] Health checks don't impact system performance

## Success Criteria

**Phase 2 Progress:**

- [x] **Step 1**: Base API client framework is implemented ✅
- [ ] **Step 2**: Market Data Agent client is functional
- [ ] **Step 3**: All API response models are defined and tested
- [ ] **Step 4**: Health monitoring system is operational

✅ **Phase 2 Complete When:**

## Debugging Notes

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Connection Issues:**
  - Verify agent URLs and ports in configuration
  - Check firewall settings and network connectivity
  - Validate SSL certificates for HTTPS endpoints

- **Timeout Problems:**
  - Adjust timeout values based on agent response times
  - Implement proper timeout handling in all methods
  - Consider async operations for better performance

- **Data Validation Errors:**
  - Check API response formats match expected models
  - Validate required fields are present in responses
  - Handle optional fields gracefully

- **Health Check Failures:**
  - Ensure health endpoints are implemented correctly
  - Check health check frequency doesn't overwhelm agents
  - Validate health status interpretation logic

## Implementation Notes

- Focus on Market Data Agent integration first
- Prepare framework for future agents (Pattern Recognition, Risk Management, etc.)
- Test with mock responses if actual agents aren't available
- Document all API endpoint requirements for future agent development
