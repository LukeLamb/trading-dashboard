## Debugging Notes

### Common Issues and Solutions
- **Performance Issues:**
  - Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
  - Monitor memory leaks with development tools
  - Test with realistic data volumes
  - Optimize database indexes and queries

- **Testing Challenges:**
  - Mock external dependencies for unit tests
  - Use test databases for integration tests
  - Implement proper test data cleanup
  - Handle async operations in tests

- **Documentation Problems:**
  - Keep documentation synchronized with code
  - Use automated documentation generation where possible
  - Test all documented procedures
  - Get feedback from actual users

- **Deployment Issues:**
