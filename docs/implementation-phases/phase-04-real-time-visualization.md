  - Use data decimation for historical views
  - Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
  - Optimize Plotly configuration for performance

- **Real-time Updates:**
  - Test with mock data streams first
  - Handle connection losses gracefully
  - Implement exponential backoff for reconnections
  - Add circuit breakers for failed updates

- **Data Quality Issues:**
  - Validate all incoming data before charting
  - Handle missing or null data points
  - Implement data interpolation for gaps
  - Add data validation indicators

- **Browser Compatibility:**
