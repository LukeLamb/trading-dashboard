# Phase 3: Advanced Agent Orchestration

**Objective:** Implement advanced orchestration features building on Phase 2 Agent Manager

**Prerequisites:** ✅ Phase 2 Agent Manager System completed with basic lifecycle management

## Phase 3 Implementation Todo List

### Step 1: Advanced Orchestration Features

- [ ] Implement agent dependency management and startup sequencing
  - [ ] Create `src/orchestrator/dependency_manager.py`
  - [ ] Define agent dependency graph structure
  - [ ] Implement dependency resolution algorithm
  - [ ] Add sequential startup based on dependencies
  - [ ] Create startup timeout and retry handling
- [ ] Add advanced process monitoring and resource tracking
  - [ ] Enhance AgentManager with resource monitoring
  - [ ] Implement CPU and memory usage tracking
  - [ ] Track process uptime and restart counts
  - [ ] Add process health scoring and analytics
- [ ] Create orchestration policies and rules
  - [ ] Implement restart policies (immediate, delayed, exponential backoff)
  - [ ] Add maximum restart attempt limits
  - [ ] Create resource usage thresholds and alerts
  - [ ] Add agent priority and resource allocation

### Step 2: Process Management System

- [ ] Build process monitoring and resource tracking
  - [ ] Implement process ID tracking
  - [ ] Add CPU and memory usage monitoring
  - [ ] Track process uptime and restart counts
  - [ ] Monitor process health via system calls
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown procedures
  - [ ] Send SIGTERM before SIGKILL
  - [ ] Wait for graceful shutdown with timeout
  - [ ] Clean up process resources properly
  - [ ] Handle shutdown failures appropriately
- [ ] Create automated restart on failure
  - [ ] Detect process failures automatically
  - [ ] Implement restart policies (immediate, delayed, exponential backoff)
  - [ ] Add maximum restart attempt limits
  - [ ] Log all restart attempts and reasons

### Step 3: Agent Control Interface

- [ ] Design agent management dashboard page
  - [ ] Update `src/dashboard/pages/agents.py`
  - [ ] Create agent status display grid
  - [ ] Add visual status indicators (green/yellow/red)
  - [ ] Display agent metadata (PID, uptime, CPU, memory)
- [ ] Add start/stop/restart controls for each agent
  - [ ] Add individual agent control buttons
  - [ ] Implement confirmation dialogs for actions
  - [ ] Add progress indicators for long operations
  - [ ] Display operation results and errors
- [ ] Implement bulk operations (Start All, Stop All)
  - [ ] Add "Start All" button with dependency ordering
  - [ ] Add "Stop All" button with reverse dependency order
  - [ ] Add "Restart All" functionality
  - [ ] Add "Emergency Stop" for immediate shutdown

### Step 4: Configuration Management

- [ ] Create dynamic configuration updates
  - [ ] Add configuration reload without restart
  - [ ] Implement configuration validation
  - [ ] Add configuration change notifications
  - [ ] Track configuration version and history
- [ ] Implement agent-specific configuration handling
  - [ ] Create per-agent configuration sections
  - [ ] Add configuration templating
  - [ ] Implement configuration inheritance
  - [ ] Add configuration environment overrides
- [ ] Add configuration validation and backup
  - [ ] Validate configurations before applying
  - [ ] Create automatic configuration backups
  - [ ] Implement configuration rollback functionality
  - [ ] Add configuration diff viewing

## Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests

- [ ] AgentManager methods work correctly
- [ ] Process monitoring functions properly
- [ ] Dependency resolution works as expected
- [ ] Configuration management validates correctly
- [ ] Restart policies behave appropriately

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Start/stop agents from dashboard interface
- [ ] Process monitoring tracks real processes
- [ ] Dependency management starts agents in correct order
- [ ] Configuration changes apply correctly
- [ ] Bulk operations work without conflicts

### System Tests

- [ ] Full system startup sequence works
- [ ] Agent failures trigger appropriate responses
- [ ] Resource monitoring doesn't impact performance
- [ ] Configuration reloads don't break running agents
- [ ] Emergency shutdown works in all scenarios

## Success Criteria

✅ **Phase 3 Complete When:**

- [ ] Agent lifecycle management is fully implemented
- [ ] Process monitoring tracks all agent metrics
- [ ] Dashboard provides complete agent control interface
- [ ] Configuration management supports dynamic updates
- [ ] Dependency management ensures proper startup order
- [ ] Automated restart policies prevent system failures
- [ ] All orchestration features are tested and committed

## Debugging Notes

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Process Management:**
  - Ensure proper permissions for process control
  - Handle zombie processes appropriately
  - Check system resource limits
  - Validate process execution paths

- **Dependency Issues:**
  - Verify dependency graph has no cycles
  - Test startup sequence with missing dependencies
  - Handle partial startup failures gracefully
  - Ensure timeout values are appropriate

- **Configuration Problems:**
  - Validate configuration syntax before applying
  - Test configuration changes in isolated environment
  - Backup configurations before modifications
  - Handle configuration merge conflicts

- **UI Responsiveness:**
  - Use async operations for long-running tasks
  - Implement proper loading states
  - Handle concurrent user actions
  - Provide clear error messages and recovery options

## Implementation Notes

- Start with basic process management, then add advanced features
- Test with dummy processes before integrating real agents
- Ensure proper error handling at all levels
- Document all configuration options and dependencies
- Consider platform-specific process management differences (Windows/Linux)
