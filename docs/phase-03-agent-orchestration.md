## Debugging Notes

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Process Management:**
  - Ensure proper permissions for process control
  - Handle zombie processes appropriately
  - Check system resource limits
  - Validate process execution paths

- **Dependency Issues:**
  - Verify dependency graph has no cycles
  - Test startup sequence with missing dependencies
  - Handle partial startup failures gracefully
  - Ensure timeout values are appropriate

- **Configuration Problems:**
  - Validate configuration syntax before applying
  - Test configuration changes in isolated environment
  - Backup configurations before modifications
  - Handle configuration merge conflicts

- **UI Responsiveness:**
  - Use async operations for long-running tasks
  - Implement proper loading states
  - Handle concurrent user actions
  - Provide clear error messages and recovery options

## Implementation Notes

- Start with basic process management, then add advanced features
- Test with dummy processes before integrating real agents
- Ensure proper error handling at all levels
- Document all configuration options and dependencies
- Consider platform-specific process management differences (Windows/Linux)
