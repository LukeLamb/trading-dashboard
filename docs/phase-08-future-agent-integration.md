- **Features:** Technical pattern detection, pattern confidence scoring
- **Dependencies:** Market Data Agent

#### Risk Management Agent
- **Endpoints:** `/risk/calculate`, `/risk/limits`, `/risk/portfolio`
- **Features:** Position sizing, risk metrics, portfolio risk assessment
- **Dependencies:** Market Data Agent, Pattern Recognition Agent

#### Advisor Agent
- **Endpoints:** `/advice/recommendations`, `/advice/signals`, `/advice/performance`
- **Features:** Trading recommendations, signal generation, performance tracking
